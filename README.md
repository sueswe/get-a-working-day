# README: looking for the next working day with a given offset

## Topic:

This code takes a date, adds an offset and is calculating if the result 
is a workingday **and** not a holiday.
If not, it hopefully returns the next available workingday.

## Usage:

~~~sh
get_a_working_day.rb YYYYMMDD offset
~~~

## Example:

~~~sh
get_a_working_day.rb 20250810 5
~~~
